// LAST THINGS TO DO (FOR WEBSITE RESPONSIVENESS (NOT CONTENT))

// 1. Implement Idle Bubbles with fade during transition

// Bubbles.svg should be inside the section element so it fades with it, this SHOULD take care of the fading
// When page is loaded...
// Select bubbles svg
// Call forever...
    // AnimateBubbles function
        // Should store all circles in the svg
        // Circles should probably be selected with different selector than 'circle', maybe so class
        // Animate them up the screen until they get to a full screen height from the initial position,
        // Then reset to initial position and run again.
        // When links are clicked, animation should continue but fade should be applied and opacity set to 0


// 2. Enable fade/transitions when first loading page (there is currently a delay)


// 3. Media Queries for different screen sizes and connection speeds
